  Organises and retrieves Markdown memory on the hosted CentricMem librarian
  (search, notes, decisions, transcripts). Use when starting a session, resuming
  after context compress / checkpoint / new chat, filing Non-Micro work,
  searching project memory, connecting an agent key, or refreshing this Skill.
  On session start, compare the loaded copy (see REFERENCE Skill refresh)
  against cm_health / ambient skill_latest and refresh if stale.

# CentricMem Agent Skill

**Names:** product/CLI = `centricmem`; GitHub install package = `centricmem-skill`; this Agent Skill folder = `centricmem-agent` (keep that folder name — it is not a second product).
Handover (when / loop). Schemas win. Branches: [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).
**Library** → **Shelf** → **Card** (summary + key points). No Inbox / `unclassified`. One key = grants. Never paste keys in chat (REFERENCE **Bearer: where plaintext is OK vs not** — claim may write a private local MCP file; docs/plans use `${VAR}` or URL-only).
**Style** of a card (voice, length, evidence density) is yours + this agent's — not a CentricMem house voice. Structure only: REFERENCE **Card contract**.

## Do not (full list: REFERENCE)

- Don't wait for "log this" / close / wrap up to file a finished chunk — sweep before you yield (§4)
- Don't write `unclassified` — pick or create a named shelf
- Don't put secrets / keys in cards, and never ask the human to paste a key or transcript in chat
- Never echo a credential value. Confirm a key with a fingerprint, not the value (`9352... len=64 fp=5E4ED29C`); never dump `mcp.json` / `config.toml` / `*.env` whole, and never redact by length threshold (short keys slip through). If a key reaches the transcript, say so in that turn and rotate it. Details: REFERENCE **Never echo a credential (agent side)**.
- Don't stop after a title-only card — every card needs summary + key points
- Don't treat this git checkout as the memory disk
- Don't let a dead session pass for a key problem: a transport failure gets the re-handshake path (section 0), and a refusal (401/403) gets the rotation path - different causes, different fixes, and never call a key unrotated from the store alone: compare three fingerprints first - the card, the process env, and whether this host is on OAuth at all.

## When to Use

Start or resume; search; file Non-Micro; connect / refresh Skill. Recipes: REFERENCE.

## 0. Reach

1. MCP only `https://mem.centricmem.com/mcp`: `cm_health` `cm_ambient` `cm_doctor` `cm_search` `cm_show` `cm_note` `cm_log_decision` `cm_done` `cm_keep` `cm_library` `cm_copy` `cm_move` `cm_delete` `cm_rename` `cm_import` `cm_index` `cm_ops`. No curl / CLI-write / bootstrap.
2. Missing tools or short grants → **connect this turn**. REFERENCE **Reach**. Remote/cloud is **not** “paste key only”: OAuth if this agent receives the browser login; paste Bearer only when it cannot. Listed OAuth hosts only: an unlisted callback shape leaves the host stuck on “connecting”, so prefer `/connect?device=` and send that callback shape to zeyu@poppyg.com (REFERENCE “Approved, but the agent stays connecting”).
   Tools that were there and then vanished, or a load-time `discover` failure, mean the MCP **session** died, not the key: probe with `centricmem doctor` (its own request, unaffected by the session), re-handshake (goose: disable then enable centricmem, or restart the host), retry once. While the session is dead, nothing here is loaded either.
3. `cm_show` = card on the **hosted** shelf (not a local junction file). `grants=["*"]` = default. Extra `mode=read` = view-only (search/show only). `ACADEMIC.md` beside this → follow it. Upsert corpus paths: REFERENCE **Import shapes** (`bundle.imported` + `rel_path`, never bare `items=`). Host-specific install, refresh or failure detail: `cm_ops` - read it when a host detail actually blocks you (librarian >=1.0.6; it is served on request rather than shipped in every copy).
4. **Writes — `items=` and `bundle` are different contracts.** `cm_note` / `cm_log_decision` / `cm_done` file cards; `cm_import` with `items=` (or `package.items`, or a zip) adds **new cards under `imported/kept/`** and nothing else. `cm_import` with **`bundle: {version: 1, …}`** is the full ImportBundle and **also writes library files**: `context` → the shelf's **`active_context.md`** (current focus, overwritten), `rules` → **`AGENTS.md` Global Rules**, plus `decisions` / `lessons` / `sessions` / `imported` / `research`. A key that can open the shelf can write those — it is **not** host-only. An unknown or mistyped top-level slot is **`400 BAD_IMPORT_BUNDLE`** (it names the slot and the allowed list), never a silent drop. Slot table: REFERENCE **Writes**.

## 1. Classify

| Skip (Micro) | Sweep (Non-Micro) |
|---|---|
| Typo, one-liner, no durable fact | Implement, ops, research, architecture, decision |
| | ≥2 real turns **or** one turn that shipped / decided |

## 2. Start

Prefer `cm_ambient` with **`shelf=`** (or `library=`) first — it already carries grants / mode / skill_latest / Recent / Session. That shapes **Recent decisions / Session tail / Curate**, not only later write routing. Ambient with only an unmatched `cwd` and no `shelf=` often shows empty Recent/Session — that is not “the shelf is empty.” Call `cm_health` only when tools are missing, connect is needed, or ambient is unhealthy / unreachable. Unreachable: say once — no bootstrap. Named shelf for writes.

**Resume = new session.** Compress, checkpoint restore, or new chat on same task → ambient first (health only if needed).

Once after ambient (or health): refresh if `skill_latest` newer. **Load path ≠ refresh path** — read the version of the copy **this host loads**, not a sibling skills dir (plugin-tree hosts: `<host-plugins-dir>/centricmem-skill/package.json`; npx `-g` / `~/.agents` does not update that tree). Install morphologies + hosts outside them: REFERENCE Skill refresh — adapt, do not invent a fourth shared hub. After a disk refresh: **re-read this SKILL.md and Do not** before the next write — installing newer ≠ acting on it. Name the key once (`mode=read` → view-only). Don't log → skip sweep. Empty shelf once: REFERENCE Existing memory

## 3. During

**chunk** = accepted unit (verified fragment, locked decision, evidenced lesson, delivery). Any in this reply → same-turn sweep. Not the whole task.
**yield** = any reply end (incl. progress).

Search/show/ambient while working. Hold half-finished. **Chunk done → sweep before you yield.**
Cards need summary + key points. Keep stubs ≠ cards. File/folder: REFERENCE Writes. Voice/density: theirs + yours (REFERENCE **Card contract**), not a CentricMem template.

## 4. Sweep — single source

No wrap-up wait. Agent close does not run this. Don't log / Skill done → skip.

**Gate:** Non-Micro chunk this reply, zero `cm_*` this session, no Don't log → **sweep before you yield**.

| File now | File at wrap-up |
|---|---|
| Locked decision; method-changing lesson; finished chunk | Version-tied stats; unverified conclusions |

Same `lessons.md` title → 409; rewrite = `cm_delete` then write (REFERENCE). Early wrong write costs more.

MCP down: hold **CentricMem deferred sweep**; connect (REFERENCE); file after health. Say so once, keep working without memory, and never fake a card, pick a local hub, or treat a leftover copy of the hub as the shelf.

`shelf=` / `library=` (REFERENCE **Shelf routing**):

1. Transcript plaintext exists → Shell-read → `cm_keep` (no paste / `path=`). Else skip keep.
2. Same batch: `cm_note` / `cm_log_decision` / `cm_done` (+ `attach`) as needed.
3. Copy/move/delete/rename leftovers: REFERENCE Writes.

## Typical Workflows

Connect: REFERENCE. **Daily:** §2 → work → §4 before yield. Empty shelf: REFERENCE Existing memory.
